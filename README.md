# GraphQLRestAPIFramework
Framework to cover graphQL APIs

Framework-Java-Lombok-POO-TestNG-Reports-Logs-Integrations

Using OOP concepts and adding reports+logs I created a framework that covers graphQL Endpoints, variables and possible conditionals in the query used in addition to using tokenization in the calls of those verbs and the execution of those Endpoints.

To run the project just download it and then open the terminal and go to the path of the downloaded project and then type 'mvn install'
